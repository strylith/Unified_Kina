## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

Your system is **well-implemented** for core functionality but needs enhancements to fully meet all professor requirements, particularly:
- Multi-factor authentication
- HTTPS enforcement
- Customer data encryption
- Exportable reports
- Complete room management UI

The foundation is solid with excellent audit trails, role-based access, and responsive design. Most missing features are enhancements rather than core functionality issues.
